- Hi, I’m @alayont-f
- I’m here because Jupyter Book and PreTeXt told me that I need a GitHub account. I’m currently learning ... well, a lot of things to list here. I’m looking to collaborate on writing code that creates interactive complex analysis visualizations and experimentation with complex numbers and functions.
- How to reach me ... Wait, I don't need to put anything here. If you can't find how to reach me using an online search, maybe you don't want to find me.
