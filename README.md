- 👋 Hi, I’m @alayont-f
- 👀 I’m here because Jupyter Book and PreTeXt told me that I need a GitHub account.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... well, a lot of things to list here.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on writing code that creates interactive complex analysis visualizations and experimentation with complex numbers and functions.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Wait, I don't need to put anything here. If you can't find how to reach me using an online search, maybe you don't want to find me.
